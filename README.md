# Personal-Blog
Personal blog for Module 4 challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to create a Blog webpage that dynamically creates list elements, saves input to local storage, and display the posts in a blog format.

As we've progressed through these challenges, i have noticed that my knowledge and understanding of the content has improved. I find it much easier to understand where a problem is yet still struggle to figure out the 'why'. 

For example, I couldnt figure out why the list elements werent being created and why the local storage was being overwritten when it clearly saved the previous array entry. It took several hours for me to understand, but i eventually realized that my problem wasnt where the elements were being created; It was that my array variales were set as 'const' instead of 'let' which prevented several functions form running properly.

All in all, (looking back on it) this challenge was pretty straight forward, i just failed to recognize several errors in my code for several hours.

I decided to take the reset css from the module 2 challenge which is originally from our course materials.
